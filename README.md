# ðŸ§  KiCad Mini Projects

This folder documents a series of small, self-directed hardware design projects created as part of my ongoing learning in **PCB design, circuit analysis, and embedded systems development**. Each project focuses on practicing a specific concept or workflow step â€” from schematic capture and component selection to layout, routing, and validation â€” all using **KiCad**.

These mini builds are my way of exploring the full hardware pipeline hands-on:
- Translating ideas into functional circuit schematics  
- Designing clean, manufacturable two-layer PCBs  
- Reviewing footprints, clearances, and signal paths  
- Experimenting with analog and digital interfaces  
- Bringing each design to life through simulation or prototyping  

While each board is small in scope, the goal is consistency and growth â€” improving attention to detail, mastering KiCadâ€™s toolset, and strengthening practical intuition for real-world hardware design.  

More projects will be added as I continue refining both **technical skill** and **design discipline** through iteration.
